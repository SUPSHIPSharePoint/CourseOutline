**SHAREPOINT 2013 TRAINING MATERIALS**

All attendees receive a copy of Wrox's Beginning SharePoint 2013: Building Business Solutions.

**SOFTWARE NEEDED FOR EACH PC:**

-   SharePoint Designer 2013 with the latest updates (optional if not creating workflows)

-   Visio 2013 Professional (optional if not creating workflows)

-   Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2013 (or 2010 if necessary), with the latest updates. Office Professional Plus includes InfoPath Designer and Filler. If no training on InfoPath is required, the Professional version of Office 2013 or 2010 may be used.

-   Internet Explorer 9 or later

-   A site collection on your SharePoint 2013 server also needs to be available for class, with each attendee having her/his own site within the collection. We have an easy-to-use setup sheet that describes how to prepare the site collection and sites for the class, and we can even check your setup remotely via WebEx after it is completed. Alternatively, at additional cost, we can provide a hosted SharePoint 2013 server for this training.

-   For classes delivered online, all participants need either dual monitors or a separate device logged into the online session so that they can do their work on one screen and watch the instructor on the other. A separate computer connected to a projector or large screen TV would be another way for students to see the instructor's screen simultaneously with working on their own.
