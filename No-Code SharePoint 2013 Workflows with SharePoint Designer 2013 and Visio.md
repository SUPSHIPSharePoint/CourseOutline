All students receive a course workbook.

**SOFTWARE NEEDED FOR EACH PC:**

Attendees will not need to install any software on their computer for this class. The class will be conducted in a remote environment that Accelebrate will provide; students will only need a local computer with a web browser with a stable Internet connection. Any recent version of Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, or Google Chrome will be fine.

For a preliminary test of your connectivity to our hosting provider, please visit [*http://speedtest.terillian.com/*](http://speedtest.terillian.com/) and click on the Start Test button. This speed test page requires Java enabled in your browser (allowing it to test multiple network functions at the same time), but Java is not needed for the lab environment that you will use in class.  When you call us about purchasing this class, we will provide a live demo of the online lab environment so that you may explore the web browser interface in more detail.

For classes delivered online, all participants need either dual monitors or a separate device logged into the online session so that they can do their work on one screen and watch the instructor on the other. A separate computer connected to a projector or large screen TV would be another way for students to see the instructor's screen simultaneously with working on their own.
